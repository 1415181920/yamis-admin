Project Introduction



A backend framework developed based on Springboot and Amis, fast and flexible~



-Building pages based on AMIS using JSON reduces front-end development workload and improves development efficiency.

-In the case where more than 100 components of Amis are not met, the front-end can be developed independently.

-The frame is separated at the front and rear ends (there is no longer any need to be tied down by the frame~).





Built-in features



-Basic backend functions



-Background User Management



-Role Management



-Permission management



-Menu management



-Code Generator



-Save Generation Record



-Import/Export Generate Records



-The generated content can be cleared using commands



-Generate full functionality without changing code



-Amis fully packaged with over 120 components, completing complex pages without the need for front-end development
